# LaJolla

Because who doesn't want to be born as a developer who just so happens to be born in, perhaps, the BEST part (La Jolla) of the BEST city (San Diego) of the BEST state (California) in the BEST country (America) in the world amirite? :P

But seriously, this just adds a spoofed follower count of 92037 followers to your Mustor app follow stats in your Mustor profile in the Mustor app for iOS.

(Also in the first screenshot, I was probably lying. Not even CLOSE to a Springtomize/MultiBoard/Calypso/IS10... whatever. This isn't even a test tweak, anyway..)

**NOTE**: Yes the name is sort of irrelevant to the tweak it actually does, in question.... but I still can't help but to overly obsess with my own birthtown sometimes.. but I am *sorta* promoting the city because it's just sooooo damn good to travel to IMO.. laid-back, beautiful, and yes, the "Lorax" tree from the video (also in The Lorax by Dr. Seuss) is dead, unfortunately, according to (various, and real - *and not fake*) news sources.. :/
